bkm - bookmark manager
----------------------

A simple CLI bookmark manager that uses plain text files to store bookmarks
under categories in a user-specified directory.

The directory is defined by BKM_DIR in $SHELL's startup file.


install
-------

Clone the repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/fehawen/bkm.git

Change working directory to bkm

    $ cd bkm

Install bkm [*]

    $ make install

Add ~/.bin to PATH in $SHELL's startup file.

    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Define where bookmarks are kept by adding the following in $SHELL's startup file.

    export BKM_DIR=~/path/to/somewhere


[*] installs to ~/bin by default, and `make install` should thus not run as root.
