bkm - bookmark manager
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple CLI bookmark manager that stores bookmarks under categories in plain
text files.

It's ridiculously naive in its implementation. Very, very simple - almost to a
point where it might actually be easier for you to just keep a text file with
bookmarks and edit said file manually. But then again, a CLI always sparks a bit
bit of geeky joy.

Written in POSIX `sh`, with the exception of `sed -i`.

And it might not work on some *BSDs due to `sed` implementation differences.

So, let's just say it's POSIX-ish, and works on my machine.

    $ make install
